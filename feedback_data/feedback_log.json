    "question": "In a circle of radius 5, what is the length of a chord that is 3 units from the center?",
    "solution": "Let $r$ be the radius of the circle and $d$ be the distance of the chord from the center.  We are given $r=5$ and $d=3$.\n\nWe can draw a radius from the center of the circle to one endpoint of the chord.  We can also draw a segment from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord. This segment will be perpendicular to the chord and have length $d=3$.  We have now formed a right triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse, the distance $d$ as one leg, and half the length of the chord as the other leg. Let $x$ be half the length of the chord.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n$$x^2 + d^2 = r^2$$\n$$x^2 + 3^2 = 5^2$$\n$$x^2 + 9 = 25$$\n$$x^2 = 25 - 9$$\n$$x^2 = 16$$\n$$x = \\sqrt{16}$$\n$$x = 4$$\n\nSince $x$ represents half the length of the chord, the full length of the chord is $2x = 2(4) = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the chord is 8 units.",

The distance from the center O to the chord is the perpendicular distance, let's call it d = 3. This perpendicular line from the center to the chord bisects the chord.\n\n**2. Key Formula: Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nWe can form a right-angled triangle by connecting the center of the circle (O), the midpoint of the chord (M), and one endpoint of the chord (A). The sides of this triangle are:\n\n* Hypotenuse: radius of the circle (r)\n* One leg: distance from the center to the chord (d)\n* Other leg: half the length of the chord (x)\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem: r^2 = d^2 + x^2\n\n**3. Solve for Half the Chord Length (x)**\n\nWe want to find x, so rearrange the formula:\n\nx^2 = r^2 - d^2\nx = sqrt(r^2 - d^2)\n\nSubstitute the given values r = 5 and d = 3:\n\nx = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2)\nx = sqrt(25 - 9)\nx = sqrt(16)\nx = 4\n\n**4. Find the Full Chord Length**\n\nSince x is half the length of the chord, the full length of the chord is 2x.\n\nChord Length = 2 * x = 2 * 4 = 8\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the chord is 8 units.\n\n\\boxed{8}",

    "question": "In a circle of radius 5, what is the length of a chord that is 3 units from the center?",
    "solution": "The question asks for the length of a chord in a circle with radius 5, where the chord is 3 units away from the center.\n\nWe can visualize this as a right triangle, where the radius is the hypotenuse, the distance from the center to the chord is one leg, and half the length of the chord is the other leg. Let $r$ be the radius, $d$ be the distance from the center to the chord, and $l$ be half the length of the chord. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $r^2 = d^2 + l^2$.\n\nIn this case, $r = 5$ and $d = 3$. We want to find the length of the chord, which is $2l$.\n\nWe have $5^2 = 3^2 + l^2$, so $25 = 9 + l^2$. Thus, $l^2 = 25 - 9 = 16$, and $l = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\nThe length of the chord is $2l = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the chord is 8 units.\n\n\\boxed{8}",

    "question": "In a circle of radius 5, what is the length of a chord that is 3 units from the center?",
    "solution": "Okay, I will provide a step-by-step solution to find the length of a chord in a circle, given its radius and the distance from the center.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a circle with radius *r* = 5 units. A chord is a line segment within the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to the chord is *d* = 3 units. We need to find the length of the chord.\n\n**2. Key Formula/Concept**\n\n*   **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right-angled triangle,  a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where *c* is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and *a* and *b* are the other two sides.\n*   The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. This means the perpendicular line divides the chord into two equal parts.\n\n**3. Solution**\n\n*   **Visualize:** Imagine the circle, the chord, and the line from the center to the chord. This line is perpendicular to the chord and bisects it. This creates a right-angled triangle.\n*   **Identify the right triangle:**\n    *   The hypotenuse of the right triangle is the radius of the circle (*r* = 5).\n    *   One leg of the right triangle is the distance from the center to the chord (*d* = 3).\n    *   The other leg is half the length of the chord (let's call it *x*).\n*   **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n    *   x\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = r\u00b2\n    *   x\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n    *   x\u00b2 + 9 = 25\n*   **Solve for x:**\n    *   x\u00b2 = 25 - 9\n    *   x\u00b2 = 16\n    *   x = \u221a16\n    *   x = 4\n*   **Find the length of the chord:**\n    *   Since *x* is half the length of the chord, the full length of the chord is 2*x*.\n    *   Chord length = 2 * 4 = 8\n\n**4.
