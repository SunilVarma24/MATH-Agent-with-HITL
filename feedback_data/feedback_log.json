    "question": "How many distinct, positive factors does 1100 have?",
    "solution": "Okay, let's break down the solution to find the number of distinct, positive factors of 1100.\n\n**1. Prime Factorization:**\n\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of 1100. We can do this as follows:\n\n*   1100 = 11 * 100\n*   1100 = 11 * 10 * 10\n*   1100 = 11 * 2 * 5 * 2 * 5\n*   1100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 11\n*   1100 = 2<sup>2</sup> * 5<sup>2</sup> * 11<sup>1</sup>\n\n**2. Number of Factors Formula:**\n\nIf a number *N* has a prime factorization of  *p<sub>1</sub><sup>a</sup> * p<sub>2</sub><sup>b</sup> * p<sub>3</sub><sup>c</sup> ...*, where *p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>,...* are distinct prime numbers and *a, b, c,...* are positive integers, then the total number of distinct positive factors of *N* is given by:\n\n(a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)...\n\n**3. Applying the Formula:**\n\nIn our case, the prime factorization of 1100 is 2<sup>2</sup> * 5<sup>2</sup> * 11<sup>1</sup>.  Therefore:\n\n*   The exponent of 2 is 2.\n*   The exponent of 5 is 2.\n*   The exponent of 11 is 1.\n\nUsing the formula, the number of distinct positive factors is:\n\n(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 * 3 * 2 = 18\n\n**4. Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, 1100 has 18 distinct, positive factors.\n\n\\boxed{18}",

    "solution": "Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a regular hexagon inside a circle. We know the radius of the circle, and we need to find the area of the hexagon.\n\n2.  **Key Formulas and Definitions:**\n\n*   **Regular Hexagon:** A hexagon with all sides equal and all angles equal.\n*   **Area of an equilateral triangle with side s:**  $A = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$\n*   **Relationship between a regular hexagon and equilateral triangles:** A regular hexagon can be divided into six congruent equilateral triangles by connecting its center to each vertex.\n\n3.  **Solving the Problem:**\n\n*   **Relating the circle's radius to the hexagon:**  Since the hexagon is inscribed in the circle, the radius of the circle is equal to the side length of each of the six equilateral triangles that make up the hexagon. In this case, the radius of the circle is 10 cm, so the side length of each equilateral triangle is also 10 cm.\n\n*   **Calculating the area of one equilateral triangle:**  Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side $s = 10$ cm:\n\n    $A = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{(10)^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{100\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 25\\sqrt{3}$ square cm.\n\n*   **Calculating the area of the hexagon:**  Since the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles, the area of the hexagon is six times the area of one triangle:\n\n    Area of hexagon = $6 \\times 25\\sqrt{3} = 150\\sqrt{3}$ square cm.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{150\\sqrt{3}}",

    "question": "Find the area of a triangle with sides 7, 24, and 25.",
    "solution": "Okay, I understand the question. We are asked to find the area of a triangle with sides of length 7, 24, and 25.\n\nFrom the context, I see that a triangle with sides 7, 24, and 25 is a right triangle because $7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625 = 25^2$.  The sides of length 7 and 24 are the legs of the right triangle, and the side of length 25 is the hypotenuse.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In a right triangle, we can use the two legs as the base and height. Therefore, the area of the triangle is:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}(7)(24) = \\frac{1}{2}(168) = 84$$\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is 84 square units.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{84}$",
